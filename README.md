This is my first React project. It represents an application-blog which makes possible for the guests to review car sport articles. Data are provided from the web site www.gracepacerace.com. There is information-home page about the blog owner, which is my daughter-Gabriela Stoycheva as well as some video. Users are able to create own articles and share comments to all other articles. Users can also subscribe for a test drive, using a relevant registration form. Test drive form is to demonstrate modal function only. 
All visitors to the application will view home page with header which has links to social media of the owner and recent photos as well as About with history of the owner and short video.
By clicking the Articles button, application will load all articles available with information about their author, create date and comments if available.

Logged users will have access to the following functionalities: Create article, Comment on article, Subscribe for test drive. Article owners can edit and delete its own articles.
