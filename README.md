This is my first React project. It represents an application-blog which makes possible for the guests to review car sport articles and comments if available. There is information-home page about the blog owner, which is my daughter-Gabriela Stoycheva. Users are be able to create articles and share comments. There is article details page with information about the owner and number of reviews. Users can also subscribe for a test drive, using a relevant registration form. Data are provided from my daughter www.gracepacerace.com.
All visitors to the application will view home page with header which has links to social media of the author as well as brief information about her with recent photos.
By clicking the Articles button, application will load all articles available with information about the owner, article create date and number of comments.
Visitors can switch between articles page and home page as well as will have access to login and register forms.
Logged users will have access to the following functionalities: Create article, Comment on article, Subscribe for test drive and filter for electric cars articles only.

The application uses React JS as a front-end and Express Node.js as a back-end. Database is supported by MongoDB.
